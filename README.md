👋 Hi, I’m Rory

🌱 I’m currently hacking on projects using Rust

👍 Bikes, PowerShell and Python are also fun.

🦬 Professionally, I am a Platform Engineer working with OpenShift/Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana and code with Ansible, Python, Go

👀 I’m also interested in playing outside, the earth, and deeping awareness around the threads that bind us together.
